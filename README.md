1.ABSTRACT:

The need of high speed multiplier is increasing as the need of high speed processors are increasing. A Multiplier is one of the key hardware blocks in most of the fast processing systems which is not only a high delay block but also a major source of power dissipation. A conventional processor requires substantially more hardware resources and processing time in the multiplication operation, rather than addition and subtraction. This paper describes about the design of 2-bit, 4-bit and 8-bit Vedic multiplier using ancient Vedic mathematics which helps in delay and power reduction. Simulation is done in Xilinx Vivado software using Verilog. The results for Vedic multiplier using various architecture and their delay comparision is done.
